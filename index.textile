"I (More About Me)":/about/ am a Senior Software Developer in the Data Science Team @ InMobi's Demand Side Platform.
I work on the Bidder component, and my work involves Large Scale Machine Learning, Software Development, and a lot of domain stuffs.
Currently I am creating a Predictive Traffic Shaping layer, also called SPO (Supply Path Optimzation), which involves extracting
the top ad requests from a pool of billions.
In the past, I worked on several intricate problem statements in ad-tech like CVR Modeling, A/B Framework, and User App Affinity Modeling.


I occasionally write about my "experiences (More About Arka)":/blog/ and love to connect with poeple.
Always up for a "chat (drop an email!)":mailto:arka.nitdgp14@gmail.com over anything technology.
